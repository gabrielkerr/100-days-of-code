### Day 1: December 28, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Remove Duplicates problem in Cracking the Code Interview in C.

**Thoughts** This will be a great way to brush up on my algorithm skills and stay fresh on C.

1. [Remove from the middle of a linked list and return kth from last item.](https://github.com/gabrielkerr/code_interview/blob/master/linked_list.c)

### Day 3: December 30, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the partitioning of linked lists on a value.

**Thoughts** There might be a small bug in this implementation when trying to partition on the max value of the list or values that are not in the list. I will fix it on the next day.
