### Day 1: December 28, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Remove Duplicates problem in Cracking the Code Interview in C.

**Thoughts** This will be a great way to brush up on my algorithm skills and stay fresh on C.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Remove duplicates from a linked list](https://github.com/gabrielkerr/code_interview/blob/master/linked_list.c)

### Day 2: December 29, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: I completed 2 linked list challenges from Cracking the Coding Interview. 

**Thoughts** I'm feeling really good about my progress and my handle on linked lists and am excited to move onto the next section .

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Remove from the middle of a linked list and return kth from last item.](https://github.com/gabrielkerr/code_interview/commit/2d9de0acea003d08c040c8559e6d6ce9c6a73f0b)

### Day 3: December 30, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the partitioning of linked lists on a value.

**Thoughts** There might be a small bug in this implementation when trying to partition on the max value of the list or values that are not in the list. I will fix it on the next day.

### Day 4: December 31, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented summation of linked lists represented in reverse order. Checked on edge cases of yesterday's implementation of linked list partitioning. 

**Thoughts** Made sure the edge cases in yesterday's project were taken care of and implemented the summation of linked lists. I felt good about thinking of edge cases and how to handle them.
